    <h1>OOPs</h1>

    <h3>Glossary Definitions</h3>
    <p><b>Instantiation:</b> The production of an instance, example, or specific application of a general classification principle, theory, etc. (Wiktionary)</p>
    <p><b>Object:</b> Objects should be the first thing you think about in designing a program. An object is an instance of a particular class of subclass with the class' own methods or procedures and data variables. (TechTarget)</p>
    <p><b>Class:</b> The blueprint for creating objects, providing initial values for variables or attributes, and implementations of the member functions(Brilliant)</p>
    <p><b>Namespace:</b> In computing, a namespace is a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified.(Wikipedia)</p>
    <p><b>Constructor:</b> A special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.(Wikipedia)</p>
    <p><b>Fixture:</b> The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. Some people call this the test context.(Stackoverflow)</p>
    <p><b>Type Hint:</b> Type hinting is a formal solution to statically indicate the type of a value within your Python code.(RealPython)</p>
    <p><b>Type Cast:</b> Type casting refers to changing a variable of one data type into another. The compiler will automatically change one type of data into another if it makes sense. For instance, if you assign an integer value to a floating-point variable, the compiler will convert the int to a float. Casting allows you to make this type conversion explicit, or to force it when it wouldnâ€™t normally happen.(DeveloperInsider)</p>
    <p><b>Unit Test:</b> Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff.(TechTarget)</p>
    <p><b>Static:</b> In computer programming, a static variable is a variable that has been allocated "statically", meaning that its lifetime (or "extent") is the entire run of the program.(Wikipedia)</p>
    <p><b>Instance Method:</b> An instance method is a method that belongs to instances of a class, not to the class itself. To define an instance method, just omit static from the method heading. Within the method definition, you refer to variables and methods in the class by their names, without a dot.(CS.ECU)</p>
    <p><b>Instance Property:</b> An instance property applies to a specific system server. When you create both a global value and an instance value for the same property, the instance value takes precedence.(IBM)</p>
    <p><b>Static Method:</b> A static method (or static function) is a method defined as a member of an object but is accessible directly from an API object's constructor, rather than from an object instance created via the constructor.(Mozilla)</p>
    <p><b>Static Property:</b> The static keyword defines a static method or property for a class, or a class static initialization block (see the link for more information about this usage). Neither static methods nor static properties can be called on instances of the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself.(Mozilla)</p>
    <p><b>Encapsulation:</b> By definition, encapsulation describes the idea of bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit, like a class in Java. This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding.(Stackify)</p>
    <p><b>Inheritance:</b> Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).(Javapoint)</p>
    <p><b>Polymorphism:</b> Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.(Stackify)</p>
    <p><b>Abstraction:</b> In object-oriented programming, abstraction is one of three central principles (along with encapsulation and inheritance). Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.(TechTarget)</p>
    <p><b>Overview of SOLID:</b> SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented principles. They are: Single-responsibility principle, Open-closed principle, Liskov Substitution principle, Interface Segregation principle, Dependency Inversion principle.(DigitalOcean)</p>
    <p><b>Overview of Design Patterns:</b> In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.(SourceMaking)</p>
